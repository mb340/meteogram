Important Note: This master branch is not being actively developed - the placeSearch branch is the "latest and greatest" and is the branch you should pull from.
I am more familiar with CVS and the way Mozilla used to use their branches, which I think is the opposite way to how Github works...

So if anyone knows the best way to "archive" this main/master branch, and turn this into the new "main/master" branch please let me know, using issue #22.

I am just a hobbyist / enthusiastic amateur - I'm sure a professional Javascript / QML programmer will be horrified with my code!
So bug reports, suggestions, code polishes and bugfixes are welcome - as are translations (as Google Translate may not have been entirely accurate)!
